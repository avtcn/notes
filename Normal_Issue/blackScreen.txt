Assuming it's the SampleViewer, showing black frame only and your uncertain about the camera?
At the statistic counters all frames dropped even the frame rate is reported as expected?
Then please double-check
- packet size adjusted,
- if fixed IP adress - in same subnet,
- proper interface ID used (info button) compared to "route print" output.
Please let me know if RMA to be issued.
